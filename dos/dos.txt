- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Denial of Service attacks aim to make a resource unavailable to its intended users. This can be achieved by overwhelming the resource with excessive requests, exploiting a vulnerability to crash a system, or any other means that interrupts the normal operation of a service. DoS attacks can be mitigated through network security measures, such as traffic filtering, rate limiting, and redundant system design

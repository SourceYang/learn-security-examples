Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Vulnerabilities are flaws or weaknesses in a system that could be exploited to violate the system's security policy.
A secure version of a system prevents vulnerabilities by implementing security measures and controls designed to identify, manage and eliminate the risks. This includes input validation, encryption, user authoritation, etc.

Spoofing does not directly target the availability aspect of the CIA triad. However, some spoofing attacks might indirectly affect availability if the attacker uses their access to launch further attacks.
